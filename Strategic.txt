Strategic Command Console for Algeria: Technical
Blueprint
Introduction: This blueprint outlines a government-grade strategic command console for Algeria – a
centralized platform to visualize and manage data across all 11 key national domains. The system integrates
information on military, economy, energy, infrastructure, health, education, agriculture,
environment, technology, internal affairs, and transportation on interactive maps with historical trends
and real-time updates . The console is envisioned in two tiers: an internal dashboard for leaders
(including sensitive intelligence data) and a public-facing portal (displaying only non-sensitive open data
for citizen transparency) . The design emphasizes modern open-source technology, robust security, and
an intuitive user experience inspired by strategy simulation interfaces. Below, we detail the architecture and
plan in phases to build this nation-scale “digital twin” of Algeria’s critical domains.
1. System Architecture
Overall Architecture: The system follows a multi-tier architecture separating concerns into
presentation, application, and data layers. The frontend UI (presentation layer) runs as a web
application (React/Next.js) in user browsers. The backend (application layer) comprises RESTful API
services (Node.js/Express via Next.js API routes) that handle data requests, business logic, and
integration with external sources. A centralized database (data layer) in PostgreSQL with PostGIS
and TimescaleDB extensions stores all domain data persistently . This three-tier design (UI → API
→ Database) provides clear separation, scalability, and maintainability.
Architecture Diagram: The high-level design can be visualized as follows: Users interact via web
browsers → hitting the Web UI (React app) → which communicates with APIs (Node.js services) →
that query/update the Database (PostgreSQL/PostGIS) and interface with External Data Sources
(public APIs, data feeds). The API layer also serves geospatial data (GeoJSON) to the frontend. All
components are containerized for deployment, enabling horizontal scaling behind a load balancer.
Multi-Tiered Design: The presentation tier (browser-based client) contains the interactive
dashboard UI and map visualizations. The application tier consists of stateless web servers (or
serverless functions) exposing domain-specific endpoints (e.g. /api/economy/gdp , /api/
health/hospitals ). It also includes background workers or microservices for data ingestion (to
fetch and preprocess external data for each domain). The data tier is a multi-model data store: a
relational spatial database augmented for time-series and analytics. This tier also includes a caching
layer (e.g. Redis) for frequently requested data or session state, and potentially a message broker
(e.g. Kafka) for streaming updates to and from the ingestion pipelines.
Backend–Frontend Interaction: All data is accessed via secure APIs. For example, when a user
selects the Economy domain and year 2022 on the UI, the frontend calls an endpoint like GET /
api/economy/gdp?year=2022 . The backend queries the database for GDP values per region and
returns JSON, which the frontend uses to color the map regions. Similarly, selecting Infrastructure

triggers an API call for infrastructure projects, returning project locations as GeoJSON features
. This dynamic client-server interaction ensures the UI reflects the latest data without page
reloads, providing a smooth single-page application experience.
Scaling and High Availability: The architecture is designed to be cloud-native and scalable.
Multiple instances of the API servers can run behind a load balancer to handle concurrent users. The
database can be replicated (with a primary for writes and read replicas for heavy read access) to
scale reads and provide high availability. In a production cloud deployment, each tier would be
isolated in its security group or VPC subnet (for example, web servers in a DMZ subnet, database in a
private subnet). The system will be horizontally scalable at the web and service layers, and vertically/
horizontally scalable at the data layer (using TimescaleDB’s partitioning and connection pooling to
handle large time-series inserts and queries).
Security and Isolation: The architecture enforces strict access control between the internal and
public versions of the console . The core infrastructure is shared, but sensitive data (e.g. military
operations) is tagged and stored such that only the internal dashboard’s API (running on a secure
network) can query it. Public-facing APIs have additional filtering or separate schemas to ensure no
confidential information is exposed. Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented at the API
level (and potentially at the database level using schema or row-level security) to enforce user
privileges. This allows, for instance, an authorized official to log into an admin interface to see
detailed or sensitive layers, while the general public accessing the portal sees only aggregated or
non-sensitive data.
Key Architectural Principles: The system is built with unified domain view and modularity in
mind. Users can easily switch between domains or overlay multiple data layers (e.g. viewing health
facility locations alongside population density) in one interface . Each domain’s components (data
ingestion, database tables, API routes, UI panels) are modular, so they can be developed and
maintained independently. The use of open-source tech at every layer ensures flexibility and avoids
vendor lock-in . The design also draws from best practices in geospatial systems (like the U.S.
NGA’s “Map of the World” concept) to provide integrated spatio-temporal views of data across
domains .
2. Technology Stack
Frontend Stack: The console front-end is built with TypeScript and React, using the Next.js
framework (React 18+) for a modern, SSR-capable single-page application. Next.js provides built-in
routing and API routes, convenient for this project’s needs. Tailwind CSS is used for efficient, utilityfirst styling, enabling a responsive and consistent design system. For UI components (tabs, sliders,
toggles, cards), the design leverages Radix UI or similar libraries for accessible, unstyled primitives,
combined with custom styles (as in this project, Radix provides accessible Tabs, Sliders, etc., with
Tailwind classes applied ). This stack ensures fast development and a polished UI/UX.
Mapping & Visualization: Interactive maps are powered by Mapbox GL JS, a robust JavaScript
library for customizable vector maps . Mapbox GL allows high-performance rendering of
geospatial data (points, lines, polygons) in the browser, including support for custom Mapbox style
basemaps and satellite imagery. Alternatively, MapLibre GL (an open-source fork) can be used to
avoid proprietary licensing. For charts and graphs, the stack includes Apache ECharts (a powerful
4

2
open-source visualization library) to create interactive charts (line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, etc.)
with minimal effort . ECharts offers dozens of chart types and is highly customizable, which suits
the variety of data in the console. In cases requiring custom visualization logic, D3.js can be
employed for lower-level control (e.g. dynamic SVG maps or complex animations). The combination
of Mapbox GL for spatial data and ECharts/D3 for statistical charts covers the full range of
visualization needs.
Backend Stack: The backend is implemented in Node.js (with TypeScript for type safety). Next.js API
routes (serverless functions) serve as the REST API layer, but one could also use an Express.js or
Fastify server if needed for more control. The database connectivity is handled via node-postgres
(pg) or an ORM/Query-builder like Knex. Indeed, the reference project uses Knex for migrations and
queries . For real-time capabilities (such as pushing live updates or alerts to the frontend), the
backend can incorporate WebSocket support or use Next.js’s built-in support for Server-Sent Events
as needed.
Database and Storage: PostgreSQL 15+ is the primary database, chosen for its reliability and opensource ecosystem. The PostGIS extension turns Postgres into a spatial database, enabling storage of
geometry types (points, polygons) and geospatial queries (spatial joins, distance calculations, etc.)
essential for the console’s map features. For time-series data (historical trends, sensor feeds),
TimescaleDB (an extension to Postgres) is used to partition and index time-series efficiently .
Timescale allows treating certain tables (e.g. yearly GDP by region, or daily electricity output) as
hypertables partitioned by time for performance and retention policy management. Using PostGIS
and Timescale together makes PostgreSQL a powerful unified repository for both spatial and
temporal data, supporting complex analyses on geospatial time-series datasets . In addition, a
Redis in-memory store may be used for caching frequent queries (e.g. latest summary stats) and for
managing real-time subscription channels if needed.
Analytics and Big Data: For most purposes, PostgreSQL with Timescale will handle the data volume
(country-scale data across 11 domains). If analytics demands grow (e.g. big data or unstructured
data analytics), the architecture can integrate tools like Elasticsearch (for full-text search or fast
aggregations on logs), or a distributed data warehouse (like Apache Druid or ClickHouse) for
specialized querying. However, initially the focus is on Postgres to keep the stack simple and
consistent. The system’s analytical computations (e.g. generating indicator aggregates or trends) can
often be done in SQL or via cached materialized views.
DevOps and Deployment Tools: All components are developed with containerization in mind.
Docker is used to containerize the web app and the database. The project can include a dockercompose.yml for local development, orchestrating the Next.js server, PostGIS database, and any
auxiliary service (like Redis). For deployment in the cloud, Kubernetes is recommended for
orchestration (managing multiple container instances, auto-scaling, rolling deployments, etc.). Tools
like Helm or Terraform can be used to manage infrastructure as code. Continuous integration/
deployment will be handled with GitHub Actions or another CI service to automate testing, building
the Docker images, and deploying to the chosen cloud environment. The technology stack remains
fully open-source at every layer (OS, DB, libraries) to maximize transparency and control .

3. UI/UX Design
User Roles & Access Levels: There are two primary user roles: Internal Officials (restricted highprivilege users) and General Public Users. Internal users (e.g. government analysts, decisionmakers) access the secure dashboard with full data, including confidential layers (like military or
intelligence data). Public users see a subset of domains and data that are approved for public
dissemination. The UI must reflect these roles – for instance, certain sensitive domain tabs or
detailed drill-down views only appear or unlock for logged-in officials. Role-based access is enforced
both in the front-end (hiding or disabling unauthorized UI elements) and back-end (API checks for
authorization on each request).
Dashboard Layout: The interface is designed as a dashboard with a map-centric view. A sidebar
(or top navbar on smaller screens) provides navigation and controls for domains and filters, while
the main panel displays an interactive map and related visualizations. In the reference layout, a left
sidebar contains domain selection tabs, a time slider, and toggles . Each domain in the
console is accessible as a tab in the sidebar menu (e.g. Economy, Infrastructure, etc., as seen with
Economy/Infrastructure tabs in the prototype ). Selecting a domain switches the content of the
main view to that domain’s data (updating map layers, charts, and info panels accordingly). The
sidebar also holds global controls like the year slider (to scrub through historical data) , and UI
settings like a dark mode toggle for theme switching .
Visual Hierarchy: The interactive map is the centerpiece, occupying the majority of screen real
estate, since spatial context is crucial for all domains. Overlaid on the map may be subtle UI
components such as tooltips or legends. The sidebar or a bottom info panel provides context and
detailed metrics for the selected domain or selected geographic area. For instance, when a region is
clicked on the map, a detail panel (card) shows that region’s key indicators across domains
(population, GDP, etc.) – this was planned as a “Detail Panel (Click map)” card in the UI . Important
information (like alerts or significantly high/low values) should be highlighted with distinct colors or
icons. Less critical controls (e.g. fine filter options or settings) are de-emphasized visually so they
don’t clutter the view. The design uses consistent color-coding per domain (for example, economic
data in one color scheme, health in another) to help users instantly identify context. All text and
controls adhere to accessibility standards: high contrast for readability, alt text for map icons, and
ARIA labels for screen readers on interactive elements.
Navigation Structure: Users can navigate between domains and also layer multiple domains
together. The primary mode is via the domain tabs (one domain at a time for clarity). However, the UI
design will allow overlaying certain datasets – e.g., a user might turn on an “Infrastructure projects”
overlay while in the Transportation domain to see how ongoing projects coincide with transport
networks. This is handled via toggles or a layer control panel in the UI. There may also be a global
search function (e.g. search for a location or keyword) accessible in the header.
Responsive and Mobile Design: The UI is built to be responsive to different screen sizes, enabling
use on tablets or phones. On smaller screens, the sidebar likely collapses into a menu, and the map
adjusts to full-screen with overlay controls. All interactive elements (buttons, sliders) are touchfriendly (adequate size and spacing). The design avoids hover-only interactions (which don’t work on
touch devices) or provides tap alternatives. Real-time updates and animations are optimized so they

•

do not overwhelm mobile browsers – for example, updating a chart or map incrementally rather
than re-rendering large DOM elements frequently.
Real-Time Updates & Feedback: The console should give users feedback on live data changes. For
critical real-time data (e.g. an environmental sensor alert, or a sudden change in a security status),
consider using WebSocket pushes to update the UI in real-time (flashing an indicator or updating a
counter on the dashboard). The UI will include an alerts/notifications area where system messages
or alerts (e.g. “Severe weather warning in X region”) can appear, especially for internal users. The
design ensures that live updates are visually distinct (using animation or color) to draw attention
appropriately without being disruptive.
Look & Feel: The console’s look balances government professionalism with a modern, engaging
aesthetic. Taking inspiration from grand strategy video games, the UI manages complex data
through intuitive maps, icons, and layered dashboards . For example, small military unit icons or
economic symbols might be used on the map at certain zoom levels, akin to strategy maps. The
color palette likely includes neutral tones for base UI and distinct highlight colors for each domain
layer (ensuring colorblind-friendly choices). The overall feel is “ultra-functional” yet visually
polished – meaning every UI element serves a purpose in monitoring or analysis, and decorative
elements are minimal. However, good use of spacing, typography, and color will make the interface
attractive and easy to read at a glance.
4. Frontend Implementation
Project Setup: Begin by scaffolding a Next.js application with TypeScript. Configure Tailwind CSS for
styling (using a config that defines the color scheme per domain, etc.) and install dependencies for
mapping and charts (e.g. mapbox-gl and echarts ). Set up a global state management using a
lightweight solution like Zustand (as used in the reference) or React Context API. In the reference
code, a Zustand store holds global UI state such as activeDomain and selectedYear with
setter functions , which components use to coordinate domain switches and timeline changes.
Layout & Routing: Implement the overarching layout in Next.js by customizing _app.tsx or using
the new app/ directory structure. For example, define a RootLayout that includes the theme
provider (for dark mode) and global styles . The homepage (dashboard) is essentially a single
page component ( app/page.tsx ) that renders the main interface. In that page, compose the
layout as a flex container: a <aside> for the sidebar controls, and a <main> for the map and
content . Use Next’s built-in <Head> to set global metadata like page title and description.
UI Components: Break down the interface into reusable components:
Domain Tabs: Build a Tabs component wrapping Radix UI’s Tabs primitive, as in the reference. The
<Tabs> , <TabsList> , and <TabsTrigger> subcomponents provide an accessible tab list,
styled via Tailwind classes . Each domain corresponds to a <TabsTrigger
value="domain">Label</TabsTrigger> , and the active domain value is bound to state (so
switching tabs calls setActiveDomain ). In our implementation, domain labels like "Economy",
"Health", etc., are rendered as tab headers.

Year Slider: Implement a slider for selecting the year (or generally a time point). The reference
wraps Radix Slider similarly . The slider range (e.g. 2010 to 2025) is configured, and its
onValueChange handler dispatches the selected year to global state . Display the current year
value and perhaps minor tick marks for clarity.
Toggle Switches: For toggles such as Dark Mode or any binary setting, use a Switch component
(Radix Switch styled) . The dark mode switch in the prototype simply flips theme context ;
additional toggles could include turning on/off live updates, or toggling data layers.
Map Component: The Map is a critical component implemented as a React component that
instantiates a Mapbox GL map on mount. In the reference Map.tsx , this is done by using a
useEffect hook to create the map with a given container, style, center, and zoom . Set the
Mapbox access token via environment variable. Once the map is loaded, add base layers (like region
boundaries). For example, the code fetches region polygons from our API and adds a filled layer to
the map . Implement handlers to update map layers when state changes: e.g., if
activeDomain or selectedYear changes, trigger a function to fetch relevant data and update
the map style. The reference does this by fetching GDP data and constructing a Mapbox data-driven
style expression to color regions based on values . Similarly, for infrastructure, it fetches
project points and either adds or updates a layer of circle markers . We will generalize this:
the Map component listens to domain/year state and calls the appropriate API (perhaps via a
mapping of domain to API endpoint) then updates layers accordingly.
Charts and Info Panels: For each domain, identify if additional charts or info panels are needed
alongside the map. For example, the Economy tab might display a small line chart of GDP over years
for the selected region or the whole country. We can integrate an ECharts component: include an
<EconomyChart> component that takes data (maybe the same data fetched for the map or a
broader dataset) and renders a line graph of GDP vs year. Similarly, a Health tab might show a bar
chart of hospital capacities by region, etc. These components can be conditionally rendered based
on the activeDomain or can be part of each domain’s panel.
Detail Card/Tooltip: Implement a component for the detail panel that appears when a map feature
is clicked. In the sidebar or as an overlay, show details like “Region: Algiers – Population: X, GDP: Y,
etc.”. The reference has a static <Card> placeholder ; we will make it dynamic: on map click,
capture the feature properties (the Mapbox GL event can provide the clicked feature’s properties),
then populate the card with relevant info from multiple domains (which might require either
preloading some summary stats or doing additional API calls on click).
State Management & Interactivity: The app uses a global store (Zustand or Context) to avoid prop
drilling for common state. This store holds at least:
activeDomain (string or enum),
selectedYear (number or date),
possibly selectedRegion (for when a region is clicked). The store provides actions like
setActiveDomain('health') which triggers all subscribed components (map, charts, etc.) to
update to the Health view. This decoupling makes it easy to add new domains – just ensure the map
update logic and any charts respond to the new state.
Best Practices: Follow React best practices: use functional components and hooks. Keep
components small and focused (e.g. separate Map layer logic by domain if it gets complex). Use
code-splitting or dynamic imports for heavy libraries (for instance, load the Mapbox GL or ECharts

libraries only on the client side and perhaps only when needed to reduce initial bundle size). Ensure
to handle loading states – e.g., while data is being fetched, show a spinner or skeleton on the map or
chart. Additionally, implement error handling in the UI: if an API call fails, display a user-friendly
message (and perhaps fallback to cached data). All user inputs (like slider or tab changes) should
update state immediately for responsiveness, while asynchronously loading new data in the
background. This provides a snappy feel as the UI changes instantly (with perhaps old data
momentarily) then refreshes with new data.
Responsive Implementation: Use Tailwind’s responsive utilities to adapt layout: e.g., on md:
screens have the sidebar visible, but on smaller screens hide the sidebar and use a hamburger menu
to toggle domain selection. Possibly implement a compact view where the map is first, and tapping a
floating “Domains” button brings up the domain list. Leverage CSS grid or flex to rearrange chart
panels below the map on narrow screens (instead of side-by-side). Test the interface on mobile
emulators to ensure charts and map remain usable (Mapbox GL supports touch gestures for zoom/
pan out of the box).
Testing the UI: As part of implementation, use Jest and React Testing Library to create tests for
components (e.g., test that switching the domain tab actually calls setActiveDomain and the
correct UI elements render). End-to-end tests with a tool like Cypress can simulate a user interacting
with the dashboard (selecting different domains, moving the year slider, etc.) to verify that the
appropriate map layers and data appear. This ensures the interface behaves correctly as it grows in
complexity.
5. Backend & APIs
API Design (REST): The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for each domain and common data
entities. These are structured logically under an /api path (as per Next.js conventions or a custom
Express router). For example:
GET /api/regions/geojson – returns GeoJSON of all administrative regions (wilayas) with their
geometries .
GET /api/economy/gdp?year=2020 – returns GDP values for each region for the year 2020 .
GET /api/infrastructure/projects – returns a list of infrastructure projects with locations
and details . Similarly, each domain would have endpoints for relevant data: e.g. /api/
health/hospitals (or health statistics), /api/education/schools , /api/agriculture/
production , etc. Endpoints are documented with their query parameters (like year or filters) and
response format. JSON is used throughout (GeoJSON for spatial data, or standard JSON for numeric/
text data).
GraphQL Consideration: While a REST approach is straightforward, an optional enhancement is to
implement a GraphQL API on top of the data. GraphQL would allow clients to query multiple
domains in one request and specify exactly which fields they need. For instance, a GraphQL query
could fetch both economic and population data for a region in one round trip. This flexibility is useful
for the internal version where custom analysis queries might be needed. However, GraphQL adds
complexity and overhead, so the initial phases will stick to REST, possibly introducing GraphQL in a
later phase if client requirements grow. Regardless, ensure API responses are consistent and
versioned (e.g., prefix routes with /v1/ if planning future versions).

Authentication & Authorization: The public-facing endpoints will generally be open for read access
(since they serve public data). However, any modifying operations or admin endpoints (if any) will
require authentication. The internal dashboard likely requires all requests to be authenticated via a
secure mechanism such as JWT tokens or session cookies. We can integrate OAuth2/OIDC if we
need single sign-on with existing government identity providers, or simply manage a user database
for the console itself. For simplicity, a JWT-based auth where the token includes roles (admin/public)
can be used; the backend verifies the token on each request and checks the user’s role to decide if
the request is authorized to access that endpoint/data. All sensitive endpoints (e.g., anything under
/api/military/* or internal intelligence data) will enforce authRequired middleware.
Additionally, use HTTPS everywhere to protect credentials and data in transit.
Data Ingestion & Synchronization: Each domain’s data needs to be kept up-to-date by ingesting
from various public internet data sources or internal feeds:
Batch ETL: For many datasets, a periodic batch fetch is sufficient. For example, to update economic
indicators, schedule a daily or monthly job that calls the World Bank API for latest figures (as
demonstrated: the script downloads a GDP CSV from World Bank ). Similarly, education or
agriculture stats might update yearly from sources like UNESCO or FAO. These jobs parse the data
and insert/update the database tables accordingly.
Real-time feeds: Some domains require near-real-time data (e.g., energy grid status, transportation
traffic, weather alerts). For these, implement streaming ingestion: for instance, connect to an MQTT
feed or a WebSocket provided by the source, or use a polling mechanism at a high frequency. An
example could be an “Energy Ingestor” microservice that polls a power grid API every minute for
current load and outages .
Microservice architecture for ingestion: Instead of one monolithic ingestor, create separate
lightweight services or scheduled AWS Lambda/Cloud Functions for each domain’s data source. Each
ingestor service is responsible for retrieving data from its source (API call, scraping, etc.),
transforming it into our database schema, and storing it. For instance, a weather ingestor might
listen to a meteorological alert RSS feed and, when a new alert is published, it inserts it into an
environment_alerts table (which the front-end could display as map markers).
Public Data Sources: We leverage open datasets. Examples: The Humanitarian Data Exchange
(humdata) provided Algeria’s admin boundary shapefiles and health facility locations (used in
sample ingest) ; the World Bank API provides economic indicators like GDP ;
OpenStreetMap can supply base infrastructure data (roads, etc.); FAO for agriculture yields; IMF or
national bank for economic forecasts; WHO for health statistics; UNdata or national stats office for
population figures, and so on. Each domain’s sources are enumerated in the Appendix.
Data Cleaning & Integration: Ingestion code must clean and standardize data (e.g., ensuring
region names match our regions table, handling missing values). The reference ingest script
shows examples: splitting national GDP into regions with random distribution for demo , or
assigning a default region_id to health projects due to missing region mapping . In production,
we would perform a proper spatial join to assign each facility to a region (e.g., using PostGIS
ST_Contains to find which region polygon contains a given point).
Synchronization and Frequency: Set an appropriate update frequency per dataset (for instance,
economic data yearly, infrastructure projects monthly, environment and transportation possibly realtime streaming). Use cron schedulers or task queues to manage these jobs. Kafka or similar
streaming platforms can be introduced if high throughput or complex pipelines (with multiple

processing steps) are needed, but initially cron jobs or lightweight queue workers (e.g., using Bull for
Node.js) will suffice.
API Implementation Details:
Use parameterized queries or query builders for all database access to prevent SQL injection. The
Next.js API route structure can co-locate files like app/api/economy/gdp/route.ts that
encapsulate the query logic . For example, the GDP endpoint verifies the year parameter or
selects the max year if none provided, then performs a SQL JOIN of GDP table with regions to get
names and codes .
Leverage PostGIS functions in queries to directly get GeoJSON output (as done with
ST_AsGeoJSON(geom) in the regions API ). This offloads geo format conversion to the
database.
Enforce caching where applicable: set appropriate HTTP cache headers for data that does not
change often (e.g. region boundaries). A CDN or reverse proxy could cache GET responses to
improve performance for public data.
Implement pagination on list endpoints if data volumes are large (e.g. thousands of infrastructure
projects) to avoid huge payloads. Alternatively, use bounding box or region filters so that clients
request only data for the visible area.
Include basic monitoring in the backend: log each request (with IP and user agent) for auditing, and
track performance metrics (perhaps integrate an APM tool like Elastic APM or Prometheus client to
record query durations, etc.).
External API Error Handling: The ingestion services and backend endpoints that call external APIs
must handle failures gracefully. Use retries with backoff for transient network issues. If a data source
is down or returns invalid data, log an error and keep the last known data rather than propagating
errors to the end-user. Also, consider rate limits of source APIs – space out calls or use local caching
to avoid hitting limits.
Authentication API: Provide endpoints for login (if needed for the internal system) – e.g. /api/
auth/login which would verify credentials (perhaps via an OAuth provider or internal user store)
and issue a JWT. For internal use, integrating with an enterprise SSO would be ideal (the blueprint
doesn’t detail this, but it should be planned). Public users won’t log in to view data, but if we allow
something like personalized alerts or saving views, a basic account system could be introduced later.
6. Database Design
Overall Schema: The database is designed with a schema per domain, or at least logically grouped
tables, while maintaining relationships through foreign keys (especially linking everything to
geographic regions). A base schema (call it public or core ) contains fundamental reference
tables like regions . Each domain then has one or more tables for its data, possibly organized in
schemas (e.g. economy.economy_gdp table, health.hospitals table, etc.) to namespace them
clearly. For simplicity, one schema is also fine, with tables named by domain prefix.
Administrative Regions Table: regions – stores the first-level administrative boundaries (e.g.
Algeria’s 58 wilayas). Columns: id (PK), name , code (like an official code or abbreviation), and
•

geom (geometry(MultiPolygon, 4326)) for the region shape . This table is central: other tables
will reference regions.id to localize data. The geometry uses SRID 4326 (WGS 84 lat/long) for
compatibility with web mapping (GeoJSON, etc.). We index the geom column with a GIST index for
spatial queries (this helps if we need to do point-in-polygon lookups or region intersections).
Economy Domain: economy_gdp – stores GDP values. Columns: id (PK), region_id (FK to
regions), year , value (numeric, e.g. in USD), and ts timestamp . We set
economy_gdp(year, region_id) as a unique composite key (each region per year). The ts
(ingestion timestamp) can serve as the time partition column for Timescale. We convert this table to
a hypertable using TimescaleDB, partitioning by time (ts) . Although GDP is annual (yearly
frequency), having time partitioning allows scaling if we ingest many years or other higher frequency
economic indicators. Additional economy tables could include economy_unemployment (region,
year, unemployment_rate), economy_trade (for trade volumes by year), etc. For now, GDP is the
example implemented.
Infrastructure Domain: infrastructure_projects – stores infrastructure projects or assets.
Columns: id (PK), name (text), type (text – e.g. road, hospital, power plant, etc.), status (text
– e.g. planned/active/completed), cost (numeric), location (geometry(Point, 4326) for a project
location), region_id (FK) . Index the location with spatial index. This table can be used for
various projects: e.g. each row might be an ongoing development project. It can be extended with
columns like start_date , end_date , etc., if needed, or a separate
infrastructure_status_logs table to track progress over time.
Health Domain: Possible tables: health_facilities (id, name, type [hospital/clinic], capacity,
location geometry, region_id). health_stats (region_id, year, metric, value) for health indicators
like number of doctors, infant mortality, etc., if needed. In the prototype, some health facilities were
ingested as sample points into the infrastructure_projects table with type 'health' ; but in a
proper design, we’d separate them into a health-specific table.
Education Domain: education_schools (id, name, level [primary/secondary/uni], location,
region_id, capacity), etc. education_stats (region_id, year, metric, value) for literacy rate, school
enrollment numbers, etc. For example, one might store literacy by region by year, or number of
schools per region.
Agriculture Domain: agriculture_production (id, region_id, year, crop, value) – storing crop
production volumes or yields. Alternatively, separate tables per category: agriculture_crops ,
agriculture_livestock with relevant metrics. If spatially granular (like data per farm or
district), link to region or use geometry if needed.
Environment Domain: environment_indicators (region_id, year, metric, value) for things like
air quality index, deforestation rate, water index, etc. environment_events (id, type [e.g. flood,
earthquake], date, location geom, description) to log environmental events or disasters. We could
also store climate data timeseries if available (e.g. temperature, rainfall by region and time).
Timescale would be very useful for high-frequency environment sensor data (like daily air quality
readings).

Energy Domain: energy_production (id, region_id, year, energy_source, value) for annual
production of oil, gas, renewables, etc. energy_facilities (id, name, type [plant, refinery, etc.],
location geom, capacity, region_id, status) for major energy infrastructure. Possibly a
energy_grid table for grid status events (if ingesting real-time load, perhaps a time-series of grid
frequency or load per region).
Military Domain: military_bases (id, name, branch, location geom, region_id) for base
locations. military_incidents (id, type, date, location geom, description) to log any security
incidents or operations. military_assets (id, type, count, region_id) for things like counts of
units or equipment by region, if such data is public (likely not – internal only). Many military data
might remain internal; the schema should be flexible to include it, but public schema might exclude
or aggregate it (e.g., just show total military personnel per region from public sources).
Internal Affairs Domain: This is a bit broad – likely covering governance, administrative data,
population, etc. We can interpret it as domestic socio-political data. Tables might include
population (region_id, year, population_count) – which is crucial base data for many domains.
internal_security (region_id, year, crime_rate or number_of_incidents). elections (for
political data if needed). For the blueprint’s sake, a population table is important: it can be similar to
GDP: region, year, population. This data could come from census or World Bank as well.
Transportation Domain: transport_network (id, type [road, railway, port, airport], geom) –
could store geometry of major transport lines or point for hubs. Alternatively, a simplified approach:
transport_stats (region_id, year, metric, value) for things like number of vehicles, traffic index,
etc. Real-time traffic or transit data could be stored in a separate ephemeral store if needed (not in
main DB). But a static table of road lengths, etc., by region could reside here.
Relationships: Most of these tables relate to regions (region_id foreign keys) to link spatially.
Ensure referential integrity: e.g., if a project’s region_id is set, it must exist in regions table (with
cascade updates or restrict deletes as appropriate). Some cross-domain relationships might exist
(e.g. linking a health facility to an infrastructure project if a hospital is a project), but those can be
handled by queries or an integration layer rather than hard foreign keys.
Use of PostGIS: All spatial columns (points, polygons) are defined with PostGIS types. This allows
queries like: find all projects within a given region polygon (spatial join), or compute distances
between points if needed. The DB can also store derived spatial data – e.g., a table of
region_centroids (precomputed points for label placement). We will use PostGIS functions such as
ST_Contains , ST_Intersection , ST_DWithin for geospatial analysis. For example, one
could query: “count infrastructure projects within 10 km of a certain location” with a single SQL using
these functions.
Use of TimescaleDB: We enable TimescaleDB on the database and convert appropriate tables to
hypertables partitioned by time. The prime candidate is any large time-series: e.g., if we store
transportation sensor readings (like traffic counts every minute) or power grid data per hour,
these tables should be hypertables. Even the annual stats tables (GDP, population) can be
hypertables by year, though the benefit is marginal at that scale. Timescale will manage partitioning
behind the scenes and can also help downsample data if needed (using continuous aggregates). The
•

combination of PostGIS + Timescale in PostgreSQL provides a powerful unified data store for spatiotemporal data analysis .
Indexes & Performance: Add indexes on key columns beyond the defaults:
B-tree indexes on any foreign keys (e.g., region_id in all tables) to speed up lookups by region.
Composite index on (year, region_id) on time-series tables for queries filtering by year and region.
GIST/GIN indexes on geometry columns for spatial queries.
If text search is needed (say searching project names or descriptions), consider a GIN index on those
text columns with the to_tsvector for full-text search.
Partition large tables by region or year if needed (though Timescale handles time partitioning; for
non-time partitioning like dividing some tables by region category, we could use Postgres table
partitioning if needed in future).
Backup & Replication: Employ a regular backup strategy: daily logical backups (pg_dump) for the
entire database, or continuous archiving (WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery). Sensitive internal
data might even require an air-gapped backup stored securely. For high availability, set up
replication – a standby Postgres read replica in a different availability zone or data center that can
take over in case of primary failure. In a cloud setup, using a managed Postgres service with high
availability (like AWS RDS Multi-AZ or Cloud SQL with failover) is recommended so that failover is
automated. The read replicas can also offload heavy read queries (like serving public analytics
dashboards) so the primary can focus on writes.
Security Measures: Secure the database at multiple levels. Use strong authentication for the DB
user accounts, and do not expose the database directly to the internet – it should only be accessible
by the backend services within the private network. Enable SSL/TLS on database connections.
Implement the principle of least privilege: the web application should use a DB user with limited
rights (e.g. only can SELECT/INSERT on certain tables, not DROP anything in production). For internal
vs public data separation, one approach is to use separate schemas or tables: e.g., have a
military_operations table that is only filled in the internal system, and the API for public never
touches it. Another approach is row-level security (RLS) policies: tag each row or table with a
classification level and use PostgreSQL RLS to allow or deny access based on user role. This is more
advanced but very powerful if internal and public apps share the same database – the internal app’s
DB user could have a role that sees everything, while the public app’s DB user role only sees rows
marked public. Such policies enforce security even if a faulty query runs, preventing leakage at the
DB level.
Data Volume and Archiving: Anticipate data growth, especially for time-series. For example, if the
system stores daily data for energy or environment over many years, the tables could grow large.
Use TimescaleDB’s retention policies to compress or drop old data that is no longer needed at full
granularity (or archive it to cheaper storage). For instance, keep minute-level sensor data for the last
year, then aggregate to hourly beyond that. Regularly analyze the database to keep query plans
efficient, and partition or index new tables as data types increase.

7. Data Visualization & Reporting
Thematic Mapping: The console will provide rich thematic maps for each domain, wherein
geographic regions or points are colored or marked according to data values. For example, in the
Economy domain, a choropleth map of GDP by region is displayed – regions are shaded in a
gradient (e.g. from light to dark) based on GDP value, as implemented in the prototype where
regions are colored yellow vs dark red depending on GDP threshold . Likewise, for the Health
domain one could map healthcare facility density or health index by region (using a color scale from
green (good) to red (poor)). The system will use Mapbox GL’s data-driven styling to achieve these
thematic maps dynamically: the API provides data, and the front-end updates the map layer paint
properties accordingly, without reloading the map tiles.
Multi-Layer Overlays: The mapping engine can display multiple layers simultaneously. The console
can overlay, for instance, infrastructure projects as points on top of a GDP choropleth. Using
distinct layer types (fill for regions, circle or symbol for points) with a legend for each ensures clarity.
Users might toggle these layers on/off. We use different visual encodings for different data types:
color fills for region-based aggregate values, scaled circles or icons for point-based data (e.g. city
population represented by bubble size), and lines for networks (e.g. showing major roads or
pipelines on the map).
Historical Trends: For each domain, showing trends over time is crucial. The UI includes time
controls (like the year slider) to animate or step through data historically . For example, the user
can slide from 2010 to 2025 and see the map update year by year (e.g., GDP growing in each region,
or population changes). Additionally, incorporate charts to depict these trends explicitly. A domain
panel might include a line chart of the national value over time, or a comparative line chart of two
regions. For instance, Economy could have a line chart of Algeria’s GDP over the last decades, or
multiple lines for different sectors if data permits. The Health domain might show a timeline of life
expectancy, etc. Using ECharts, we can animate the charts for transitions or allow user interaction
(tooltips on hover, zoom into a time range). The data for these charts comes from the same database
– often pre-aggregated for performance (or we retrieve all years of data for a metric and let ECharts
handle plotting).
Indicators and KPIs: Each domain will have key indicators that need highlighting. These might be
shown as big number widgets or in a summary panel. For example, for Education: “Literacy Rate:
85%” or for Economy: “GDP Growth: +3.2%” for the latest year. These indicators can be placed at the
top of the domain section or on the map as labels. Consider using cards or badges in the UI to
display a few critical numbers when a domain is selected or when a region is selected. E.g., clicking a
region could show “Population: X, GDP per capita: Y, Main Crop: Z” etc., giving a quick snapshot
across domains for that region.
User-Driven Analytics: Provide interactive filters or query tools for users to create simple analytics.
For instance, allow the user to select two regions and compare their metrics side by side (could pop
up a comparison chart). Or allow selection of a time range to see averaged values. While not full BI,
these little interactions empower users to explore data beyond static dashboards.
Tooling for Visualization: The implementation uses Apache ECharts due to its wide range of chart
types and built-in interactivity (zooming, tooltips, legends). ECharts can produce bar charts (e.g. top
•

•
•

•
•
•
13
5 regions in something), pie charts (e.g. breakdown of energy sources in total production), scatter
plots (e.g. comparing two indicators like education vs income by region), and even map
visualizations. If needed for custom visuals, D3.js might be used – for example, creating a custom
projection map or a very tailored chart. But D3 can often be avoided by using ECharts or existing
React chart libraries unless we have very custom requirements. Chart.js or Plotly are alternatives,
but ECharts is chosen here for its flexibility and performance with large datasets.
Maps Implementation Details: The base maps come from Mapbox (which includes country and
region boundaries possibly). However, since we have our own region polygons in the database, we
use those for accuracy and control. The map will include a legend and maybe a time slider UI
element on the map when playing an animation. We ensure the map is interactive: users can zoom,
pan, and click on features. On click, we handle events to show detailed info as described. If needed,
we could incorporate 3D visualization via Mapbox for certain data (e.g. extruding polygons by value
to show a 3D prism map of, say, GDP or population). Or using CesiumJS for a globe view if ever
expanding to global context, but likely not necessary for this national console.
Reporting and Exports: Beyond interactive use, the platform might allow generating reports. This
could be as simple as allowing the user (especially internal) to export the current view’s data or chart
as an image or PDF. For example, integration with a library to take a snapshot of the map and charts
and compile a PDF report. Or provide CSV export of the data behind a chart. These features can be
added to the UI (e.g., an “Export” button on each widget). Additionally, for recurring reports, a
server-side process could generate summary PDFs monthly with key metrics (though that is a
feature beyond the core interactive console).
Example Visualizations: To illustrate:
Economy: Choropleth map of GDP per region (color intensity by GDP); line chart of GDP over years
(national total or per region when selected); bar chart of GDP by sector if data exists.
Health: Map with hospital locations (point markers sized by capacity) and perhaps regions shaded
by healthcare index; a line chart of life expectancy over time; a gauge or percentage for current
hospital capacity usage.
Energy: Map showing energy infrastructure (e.g. power plants as icons, pipelines as lines) and
regions colored by oil production; a real-time gauge of current electricity grid load; a bar chart
comparing production of different energy types.
Environment: Heatmap or choropleth for an environment indicator (like air quality index by region);
time-lapse of deforestation area by year; an alert banner for any active weather warnings.
Transportation: Map overlay of traffic conditions (if live, maybe green/yellow/red on major roads);
or static map of transport network; chart for traffic growth over time or top 10 busiest routes.
Ensuring Clarity: Each visual element will include labels, legends, and tooltips to make it selfexplanatory. For example, the map will have a legend mapping colors to values (we can dynamically
generate this based on data range). Charts will have axis labels and a brief title. Where needed,
include units (e.g., “GDP (USD)”). The design avoids overly cluttering the screen by showing too many
visuals at once – instead, contextually show the right visual when the user needs it (like only show
detailed charts when a region is selected or on user request).

8. AI Assistant Roadmap
Vision for ChatGPT Integration: In later phases, the platform will include an AI Assistant
embedded in the console – essentially a chatbot powered by ChatGPT (GPT-4) that can answer user
queries, explain data, and provide insights. The goal is to allow natural language interaction with
the dashboard . Users (especially non-technical decision makers or the public) could ask
questions in plain English (or French/Arabic as needed) and get answers or even dynamic visual
responses.
Example Use Cases:
Dynamic Querying: A user asks, “Which region had the highest GDP growth in the last 5 years?” The
assistant would interpret this, query the relevant data (perhaps via an internal API or database
query), and respond: “Region X had the highest average GDP growth of Y% from 2020 to 2025.” It could
also highlight that region on the map or show a quick chart. Another query: “Show me the number of
hospitals per capita in Algiers vs Oran.” The assistant could produce a small comparison chart or at
least cite the figures.
Insight Summarization: The AI could provide summaries like “The data shows that while overall
infrastructure spending increased, certain regions lag behind. For example, Region A has 30% fewer
ongoing projects than Region B.” – effectively digesting raw numbers into insights.
Alerts and Anomalies: The assistant might proactively notify “Alert: The latest data indicates an unusually
high pollution index in Region Y compared to historical norms” if connected to anomaly detection. A
user could also ask “Any notable changes this week?” and the assistant would summarize significant
data changes or events detected.
Conversational UI Help: The assistant can also help users navigate the console itself: “How do I add the
transportation layer?” and it can respond with instructions, making the application more user-friendly.
Integration Plan:
Phase 1 (Prototype Assistant): Start with a simple Q&A chatbot panel in the UI (perhaps a chat icon
the user can click). Initially, it might not be fully connected to live data – it could answer static FAQs
or provide guided help. This familiarizes users with the concept.
Phase 2 (Connect to Data): Use the OpenAI API to connect ChatGPT to the console’s data. Likely, we
will implement a middleware where user questions are parsed, relevant data is fetched from the
database or APIs, and then a prompt is constructed for GPT that includes that data or summary. For
example, if user asks about GDP, the system does a DB query for GDP values and inserts the results
into the prompt asking GPT to analyze or format it. This ensures factual accuracy (since GPT itself
wouldn’t have up-to-date data about Algeria unless provided). This could be done using techniques
like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the system retrieves relevant info then asks GPT
to form an answer with it.
Phase 3 (Advanced Capabilities): Train or fine-tune custom AI models if necessary (for example, a
fine-tuned model that knows the structure of our data and can translate questions to SQL). Also
integrate the assistant with the user context – e.g., if the user currently has the map zoomed to a
region, the user can ask “What is the population here?” and the assistant uses the context (current
region selection) to answer. The assistant could also handle multi-turn dialogue: “List the regions with
•
54
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
15
lowest literacy.” → [assistant answers] → “What about their unemployment rates?” and it retains context
of which regions we are discussing.
UI for Assistant: The assistant will appear as a chat sidebar or overlay. The user can type or use
voice (if feasible) to ask questions. The assistant’s answers could include not just text but also charts
or triggers to update the map. For instance, an answer might be accompanied by a button “Highlight
this on map” or it may automatically flash the relevant layer. Initially, keep it simple (textual answers
with perhaps markdown for formatting and maybe ASCII tables or simple figures). Later, integration
with the actual dashboard elements can be tighter (like programmatically toggling a layer in
response to a query).
Technical Implementation: We will utilize the OpenAI API (or an Azure OpenAI instance if data
sovereignty is a concern) with the GPT-4 model (or GPT-3.5 for lower cost where acceptable). Queries
from the frontend will be sent to our backend, which will:
Check user permissions (so that internal users can get answers including sensitive data, while public
user queries are constrained to public data).
Translate the natural language query into a structured form. This might involve some heuristic or
using GPT itself with a prompt: “Extract the intent and parameters from this question”.
Fetch required data. For example, if query is about GDP in last 5 years, the backend runs an SQL
query to get those data points.
Construct a prompt for ChatGPT that includes a brief context (maybe a system message describing
the data format), the data (maybe as a small table in the prompt or a summary), and the user’s
question, asking it to answer based on provided data.
Return the answer to the frontend and display it in the chat UI.
This approach ensures the AI’s answers are grounded in the actual data we have, mitigating hallucinations.
For simpler factual queries, we could bypass GPT entirely and have canned responses or direct data output
(like if user asks a straightforward numeric fact, the system might answer directly). However, the power of
GPT will shine in open-ended questions or requests for summarization.
Multilingual Support: Since Algeria’s official languages include Arabic and French (besides English
for some data), the assistant should handle queries in these languages too. GPT-4 is capable of
multilingual understanding, so we can allow the user to ask in French, for instance, and either
translate internally or let GPT respond in the same language. It would be valuable to have answer
translation capabilities or prompt GPT to answer in the query’s language for inclusivity.
Privacy and Safety: If using the public OpenAI API, careful consideration is needed for data privacy
– sensitive internal data should not be sent in prompts to an external service unless via an approved
channel. We could restrict the AI assistant for the public portal to only use public data (which is fine
to send to the API). For the internal system, if extremely sensitive data is involved, a future plan
could be deploying an on-premise LLM (there are emerging open-source large models) so that data
never leaves government premises. Initially, though, using ChatGPT via API for non-sensitive Q&A is
acceptable and hugely beneficial.
Future AI Features: In addition to Q&A, the assistant can be expanded to tasks like scenario
simulation (though that’s complex – e.g. “If we increase investment in region X by 10%, what

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
16
happens to GDP?” – the assistant could attempt an answer based on known multipliers or simply
state it hypothetically). It could also integrate with notification systems: e.g., a user could tell the
assistant “Notify me if any new infrastructure project appears in region Y”, essentially setting up an alert
subscription. The AI would remember this and when the data ingestion adds a project in region Y, it
could prompt a notification (this requires a background job with the AI or some event triggers to the
chat). Such features blur into intelligent alerting systems.
Citing Data and Transparency: To maintain trust, especially for public users, the assistant should
where possible cite the data sources it used (much like how this document uses citations). We can
program the assistant to include references or at least mention “According to World Bank 2024
data, ...”. This way, the information remains transparent and users can verify the facts if needed.
Internally, citing sources is also helpful for analysts (e.g., if the AI says something about military
data, it should indicate it came from a certain database table or report).
In summary, the AI assistant will transform the console from a passive tool into an interactive analytical
assistant, allowing users to query and comprehend the data through natural dialogue . The roadmap is
to start simple and gradually build up the assistant’s integration and intelligence over later phases once the
core system is in place.
9. Testing, CI/CD, and Security
Quality Assurance (QA) Strategy: A comprehensive testing approach is crucial for a mission-critical
government platform. We implement multiple testing layers:
Unit Tests: Write unit tests for utility functions (e.g. data parsing, statistical calculations) and for
React components logic. For instance, test that the data ingestion parser correctly transforms source
data into the expected database inserts (could use sample CSV/JSON as input and verify SQL output).
Integration Tests: Test the end-to-end behavior of API endpoints with the database. Using a testing
database (or a test schema), we can seed some known data and run HTTP calls to the API (using a
tool like Supertest or directly calling Next APIs) to ensure the responses match expected JSON. For
example, test that GET /api/regions/geojson returns valid GeoJSON with all regions when the
regions table is populated with sample regions.
Frontend Tests: Use Jest + React Testing Library for component tests (ensuring that when
activeDomain state changes, the correct components render). Also use an end-to-end testing
framework like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user flows in a headless browser. This can cover
scenarios such as: “User opens the app, clicks on Infrastructure tab, map markers load, user moves
slider to 2020, GDP map updates accordingly, user toggles dark mode and sees UI theme change.”
These E2E tests will catch integration issues between front and back.
Performance Testing: Particularly for the backend and database, do load testing with tools like
JMeter or Locust. Simulate heavy usage (e.g., many users requesting data simultaneously, or large
data ingestion loads) to see how the system holds up. This helps in tuning the database (perhaps
adding indexes) and scaling infrastructure appropriately. For the map, performance test by loading
large datasets in the browser and ensuring the rendering is still smooth (Mapbox can generally
handle thousands of points; if needed, we might cluster or simplify data for client).
Security Testing: Conduct regular penetration tests and code reviews focused on security. Use
static analysis and dependency vulnerability scanners (like npm audit , Snyk) to catch known
vulnerabilities in packages. For web security, run OWASP ZAP or similar to test the deployed
•

•
•
•

17
application for common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, etc.). Ensure that all input handling in the
API is safe (our use of parameterized queries and Next.js/Express’s built-in protections helps). Also
test role-based access: confirm that an unauthorized request cannot retrieve restricted data (attempt
to bypass the UI and call internal endpoints without a token, etc., should be forbidden).
Linting and Code Quality: Adopt a strict linting configuration using ESLint (and possibly
TypeScript’s tsc compiler checks) to maintain code quality. This enforces best practices and catches
potential bugs early (like unused variables, or forgetting to handle an error case). Additionally, use
Prettier to auto-format the code for consistency, which helps in a multi-developer team. Run these
linters as part of the CI pipeline so that no code can be merged that fails linting or tests.
Continuous Integration (CI): Set up CI (for example, GitHub Actions) to run on every push/PR. The
CI pipeline will:
Install dependencies and run the full test suite (unit + integration tests).
Lint the code.
Possibly build the production bundle to ensure it compiles. Only if all checks pass can the code be
merged/deployed. This guarantees that broken code doesn’t make it to production.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Use infrastructure that supports automated deployments. For
instance, after CI passes on the main branch, a CD pipeline can build a Docker image of the web app
and push it to a registry, then trigger a deployment to the cloud (Kubernetes cluster or App Service).
We can use tools like Argo CD or Jenkins for more controlled deployment. The deployment strategy
will be blue-green or rolling deployments to minimize downtime: spin up new version containers,
test health, then switch traffic and retire old ones. Maintain a staging environment (identical to
production in setup) where the release is deployed first for final verification (either by QA team or
automated smoke tests) before promoting to production.
Security Best Practices: Security is paramount since this is a government system:
Web Security: Implement HTTPS everywhere (obtain TLS certificates for the domain, use HSTS
headers to enforce). Use secure cookies with HttpOnly and SameSite flags for any session tokens.
Implement CSRF protection for forms if needed (Next.js has built-in CSRF tokens for API routes if
using their auth, or we can use libraries). All API endpoints validate and sanitize inputs (though many
endpoints are read-only and take simple numeric params like year, which we parse and validate).
Authentication Hardening: If using JWT, use strong signing keys, short token lifetimes, and refresh
tokens as needed. Possibly integrate MFA for internal users. Monitor login attempts to detect brute
force.
Authorization Checks: Double-check that every sensitive operation in the backend checks user
roles. For example, even if the front-end hides the “Delete Project” button for public users, the
backend endpoint /api/infrastructure/delete must still verify the requester is an admin.
Database Security: As mentioned, restrict network access to DB, and use least privilege for DB
users. Enable logging for database (logins, query errors) to audit any suspicious activity.
Encryption: Ensure any sensitive data stored (if any, perhaps internal notes or credentials) is
encrypted at rest. Use column-level encryption or built-in pgcrypto for extremely sensitive fields
(though likely not needed for mostly numeric geo data). Backups should be encrypted too.

Dependency Management: Keep all libraries up to date with patches, especially those related to
security (web frameworks, etc.). Have a schedule or tooling for upgrades.
Dos Protection: The public API should have rate limiting to avoid abuse. Implement middleware to
throttle requests per IP (especially on expensive endpoints). Potentially use a WAF (Web Application
Firewall) in front of the application (cloud providers offer this) to automatically block common attack
patterns.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Set strong CSP headers to prevent XSS by only allowing scripts/
resources from our domain and trusted sources (like Mapbox domain for map tiles). Also, use other
headers like X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc., to harden the client side.
Logging and Monitoring: Implement centralized logging (e.g., send logs to ELK stack or a cloud
logging service). Monitor logs for errors or security events. Also use uptime monitors and set alerts
for unusual metrics (like sudden spike in traffic, indicating potential attack or misuse).
Penetration Testing and Audits: Engage security auditors to do a penetration test especially before
going live and periodically thereafter. The system should comply with any national cybersecurity
requirements (perhaps Algeria has specific standards or certifications for government software).
Continuous Improvement: Use the findings from tests and monitoring to improve. For example, if
certain queries are slow under load (as revealed by performance tests or APM in production),
optimize them (add index or caching). If the UI tests reveal a flakiness (maybe map loads slowly on
first try), consider preloading certain data. Treat security as ongoing: new vulnerabilities will arise, so
keep an eye on security bulletins for all components (OS, DB, libraries) and patch promptly. The CI/
CD pipeline can be extended to include security scans (e.g., container image vulnerability scanning,
secret scanning to ensure no keys accidentally committed).
By rigorously testing and securing the system at each step, we ensure the final product is reliable, robust,
and safe against threats, which is essential for a platform of this importance. Regular QA cycles and
automated pipelines guarantee that development can move fast without breaking critical functionality or
compromising security.
10. Phase Breakdown
Building this Strategic Command Console is a complex endeavor. We divide it into phases with clear goals,
timelines, and milestones to manage development effectively and allow incremental delivery of value:
Phase 0: Planning & Requirements (1 month) – Goal: Gather detailed requirements from
stakeholders and finalize the technical stack. Activities include stakeholder meetings (e.g. ministry
officials for each domain), data source identification for all 11 domains, and drafting of technical
design (this blueprint). Milestones: Requirement specification document approved; data source list
confirmed; project plan (phases, timelines) agreed upon.
Phase 1: Core System & MVP (3-4 months) – Goal: Implement the foundation of the platform
covering 2-3 domains as a Minimum Viable Product.
Deliverables: Basic system architecture running: user interface with map and sidebar, backend with
region and two domain endpoints, database with core tables.

Focus domains in MVP: for example, Economy and Infrastructure (since those are already
prototyped) and perhaps Population (Internal Affairs) for a demographic baseline. These provide
both a choropleth (GDP or population) and point data (projects) use case.
Features in Phase 1: Region map display, domain tab switching, year slider working with data, dark
mode toggle, a couple of charts (e.g., GDP trend line). Also, an initial data ingestion script or process
for those domains (fetching data for economy & infrastructure from open sources and populating
the DB).
Milestones: End of Phase 1 should have a working dashboard that can be demoed – e.g., a user can
open it and see a map of Algeria colored by GDP and see infrastructure project points, and switch
the year to see change. Also, internal demonstration to stakeholders to gather feedback.
Phase 2: Expand Domains & Data Integration (3 months) – Goal: Add the rest of the domains and
enhance data ingestion.
Deliverables: All 11 domains’ basic data are integrated and displayed. This means creating the DB
tables, API endpoints, and front-end visualization for each remaining domain: Military, Health,
Education, Agriculture, Environment, Technology, Transportation, and any others needed (ensuring
alignment with the final agreed domain list).
Each domain might be tackled one by one: e.g., Month 1 of Phase 2 add Health, Education,
Agriculture; Month 2 add Environment, Energy, Transportation; Month 3 add Military, Technology
and any internal metrics.
Data ingestion: Set up scheduled jobs or scripts for each domain’s data. Possibly introduce a
message queue or background worker system now as needed. Ensure data update frequency and
pipeline is solid.
New features: Introduce role-based access control – implement the authentication system and have
a way to log in (at least a rudimentary login for internal users) and show/hide data accordingly. The
public vs internal mode can be toggled in config for now.
UI enhancements: Add legends, basic tooltips, and refine the UX from Phase 1 feedback. Also
ensure mobile responsiveness by this stage.
Milestones: By end of Phase 2, the console is essentially feature-complete in terms of data coverage.
A beta release could be done for internal users to test all domains. We expect feedback on data
accuracy, UI clarity, etc., to address in next phase.
Phase 3: Advanced Features & AI Assistant (2-3 months) – Goal: Implement advanced analytics
features and the AI assistant; harden the system for production.
Deliverables: Integration of ChatGPT assistant into the UI with the ability to answer queries using
the system’s data. Advanced visualization features like compare tool or overlay multiple domain
layers. Possibly a notifications/alerts system for critical changes.
Implement the AI Assistant panel as described: at least a functional Q&A that can answer a
predefined set of questions or simple queries by pulling data. This might involve a couple of sprints
to integrate OpenAI API and test questions for each domain.
Performance scaling: If any bottlenecks were identified, resolve them now (e.g., optimize slow
queries, add indexes, increase resources for servers). Conduct a load test with near-realistic usage
volumes and tune accordingly.

Security hardening: Complete penetration testing and fix any issues. Prepare for public deployment
by ensuring all security measures are in place (web and data).
Milestones: End of Phase 3 should coincide with a v1.0 release of the platform for internal use and
potentially public preview. The AI assistant might still be in beta (with limited knowledge base) but
present. The system should be ready to handle real data updates and user load. At this point,
documentation (user guide, admin guide) is prepared as well.
Phase 4: Deployment & Public Launch (1 month) – Goal: Deploy the system on production
infrastructure and launch the public portal.
Activities include deploying to cloud (or government servers), setting up domain name and HTTPS,
final data refresh before launch, and monitoring initial usage.
Milestones: Public launch event or announcement. The public-facing portal goes live with a subset
of data (non-sensitive), while the internal system is live for government use. Collect user feedback
and bug reports.
Phase 5: Iteration and Maintenance (Ongoing) – After launch, enter an iterative development
cycle. This includes:
Adding enhancements (maybe 3D maps, more granular data as it becomes available, etc.).
Possibly integrating predictive analytics or “what-if” scenarios modeling in the future.
Continuous data updates and perhaps integration with more external systems (like if new APIs or
data sources come online).
Maintenance tasks: applying security patches, upgrading dependencies, managing scaling as usage
grows.
Each phase has buffer time built in for testing and feedback integration. The timeline can be adjusted based
on resource availability; however, overall a project of this scope might be ~8-12 months to initial full system,
plus ongoing improvements. Throughout phases, maintain close communication with end-users to ensure
the console meets their needs at each step. Prioritize features such that even if some get delayed, the core
mission of a unified strategic view is achieved early.
11. Deployment Strategy
Infrastructure Selection: The deployment will use a cloud-based infrastructure for reliability and
scalability. This could be on a public cloud like AWS, Azure, or GCP, or a private government cloud if
required by data policies. For illustration, consider using AWS:
Use Amazon EKS (Kubernetes) or AWS ECS to deploy Docker containers of the application.
Kubernetes gives flexibility to manage multi-container setup (web app, background workers, etc.)
and perform rolling updates.
Use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to host the PostGIS/TimescaleDB database in a managed way
(with Multi-AZ for high availability). Ensure that PostGIS extension is enabled. (TimescaleDB can be
enabled on RDS via a PostgreSQL extension if Amazon allows it, or use Timescale’s own managed
service if needed.)
Use ElastiCache Redis for caching if we incorporate Redis.

This setup isolates application concerns and uses managed services for critical data storage to
reduce maintenance burden.
Domain Name and Routing: Register a domain (likely under a government TLD, e.g.,
digitalconsole.algeria.gov.dz or similar). Use a DNS service to point this domain to the
front-end load balancer. For AWS, one might use Route 53 for DNS. The application will be served via
HTTPS on this domain – obtaining an SSL certificate (using AWS Certificate Manager or Let’s Encrypt)
for encryption. All traffic will go through HTTPS (TLS 1.2+).
Network Topology: Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with at least two subnets: a public subnet
for the load balancer (to receive internet traffic) and private subnets for application servers and
database. The EC2 instances or containers running the Node.js servers will reside in private subnets
(with no direct public IPs; only the load balancer can communicate with them). The database is in a
private subnet accessible only by those app servers. This ensures an extra layer of security.
Load Balancing & CDN: Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or similar to distribute incoming
requests to multiple application instances (for horizontal scaling and redundancy). Additionally,
employ a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets. The Next.js app can emit a static
bundle (JS, CSS, images). Using a CDN like CloudFront or Azure CDN to cache these globally will
speed up access for users (especially if the public might include diaspora or international
researchers accessing it globally). The CDN can also cache common API GET responses if configured
(though dynamic data might not be cached heavily due to real-time nature). Also, enable HTTP/2 and
keep-alive to optimize network usage.
Containerization & Orchestration: All application components (Next.js app, any microservices like
the data ingestors if they run continuously) will be packaged into Docker images. We’ll have a CI
pipeline push these images to a registry (like AWS ECR). The deployment uses a Kubernetes manifest
or Helm chart that defines the desired state: e.g., 3 replicas of the web app, 2 of the ingestion
service, etc., and includes ConfigMaps/Secrets for environment variables (DB connection strings, API
keys like Mapbox token, OpenAI key). The orchestration ensures if a container goes down, it is
restarted automatically. We can allocate resource limits (CPU/memory) to each container to ensure
stability.
Scaling and Performance: Configure auto-scaling policies. For instance, if CPU usage on web app
containers goes above 70%, scale out by adding another replica. The database can be scaled
vertically (assign more vCPUs/RAM) as data grows, and read replicas can be added if needed. Using a
load balancer and stateless app servers means scaling horizontally is straightforward. For the
Node.js part, also consider using PM2 or running multiple Node cluster workers per container to
utilize all CPU cores of the machine if not using many small pods.
CI/CD Deployment Flow: When new code is merged and tested (as per CI pipeline), the CD will build
the Docker images, push to registry, and then update the Kubernetes deployment (e.g., via
kubectl apply or an ArgoCD sync). The update is done with rolling update strategy – gradually
replacing containers with new version without downtime. We’ll monitor error rates during
deployment; if something goes wrong, have an automated rollback or manual rollback procedure
(Kubernetes can keep previous ReplicaSet for quick rollback).

Logging & Monitoring in Production: Use cloud monitoring services: e.g., CloudWatch for logs and
metrics on AWS, or Prometheus/Grafana if self-hosting monitoring. All server logs (API requests,
errors) should go to a centralized log group. Implement log rotation and retention policies (e.g.,
keep 90 days of logs). Set up monitors for key metrics: CPU and memory of containers, response
latency of APIs, number of requests, and DB metrics (connections, slow queries). Also, uptime
monitors (like a simple ping to the health endpoint of the app) to alert if the site goes down.
Configure alerts (email/SMS) for critical events: e.g., if the site is unresponsive, or if CPU is maxed
out, or if unusual spikes in traffic (potential DDoS) occur.
Database Management: For RDS, enable automated backups (daily snapshots, retain for X days).
Also enable write-ahead-log (WAL) backups for point-in-time recovery (PITR) so the database can be
restored to any moment in case of issues. For major upgrades of the database or changes in
schema, plan maintenance windows (the system could show a “read-only mode” or maintenance
banner if needed during a migration). In Kubernetes, one might run the DB outside of K8s (managed
service) to avoid state issues.
Security in Deployment: Use security groups or firewall rules to restrict access. Only the load
balancer’s security group allows public HTTP/HTTPS inbound. The app servers’ group accepts traffic
only from the LB (for HTTP) and maybe from a bastion host (for SSH if absolutely needed). The DB’s
group accepts traffic only from app servers. All egress internet access from servers should be
restricted if possible, except what’s necessary (like contacting external APIs for data ingestion). Keep
systems updated: use base images that are updated with security patches regularly. Also, if using
Kubernetes, regularly update cluster and ensure RBAC rules are in place (so one compromised
component doesn’t compromise everything).
HTTPS and Certificates: Obtain an SSL certificate for the domain (could be government provided or
using Let’s Encrypt for public interface). Configure the load balancer or ingress controller to handle
TLS termination. Enforce redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. Use modern TLS ciphers and disable outdated
ones.
CDN & Caching Strategy: Configure caching headers for static assets (like versioned JS/CSS can be
cached for a year). Dynamic API responses might be set to no-cache or short cache (depending on
how fresh data needs to be – e.g., maybe cache non-critical data for a minute to reduce load). The
CDN can also act as a layer to absorb traffic spikes. For map tiles (if using Mapbox) – those are
served by Mapbox’s CDN by default. If using self-hosted tiles, consider caching those as well on
CloudFront or a tile server with caching.
Domain Partitioning: If needed, host internal and public on separate subdomains or domains
entirely to clearly separate (e.g., internal might be only on a secure network or VPN, not accessible
from internet at all). The deployment for internal could be on a separate environment or cluster with
additional layers of security (no public DNS, IP allow-lists, etc.). This blueprint focuses on publicfacing, but it's likely parallel deployment for internal on a closed network.
Disaster Recovery: In addition to multi-AZ high availability, plan for DR in a different region (e.g.,
periodic backups copied to another region or a warm standby cluster that can be spun up if the
primary region fails). The infrastructure config (like Terraform scripts, Helm charts) should be stored
in source control so the entire stack can be recreated if needed in a new environment.

Testing the Deployment: Before live launch, do a staging deployment with the full pipeline to iron
out any config issues. Do load tests on the deployed staging environment to ensure autoscaling
triggers correctly, etc. Also test failure scenarios: e.g., kill a container to see if new one boots up (to
test auto-healing), simulate DB failover if possible, etc.
In summary, the deployment strategy leverages cloud best practices: infrastructure-as-code,
containerization, load balancing, auto-scaling, and robust network security. The outcome will be a scalable,
highly available, and secure production environment for the Algeria Strategic Command Console,
accessible globally for public transparency (and on a secure network for internal use), with minimal
downtime and easy maintainability.
12. Appendix
A. Public Data Sources by Domain: Below are example sources that can feed each domain’s data,
demonstrating the openness and diversity of information:
Military: Open data for military is limited due to sensitivity. Public sources like SIPRI (Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute) provide data on military expenditures and arms transfers.
The console could use publicly released defense budgets or number of personnel (if available via gov
white papers). For base locations or unit info, one might use Wikipedia or openstreetmap (some
bases might be marked on maps). (Example query: “What is Algeria’s defense budget?”) – could be
answered by data from SIPRI’s military expenditure database.
Economy: Rich public data exists. The World Bank Open Data API is a prime source for
macroeconomic indicators (GDP, GDP per capita, inflation, unemployment) . Other sources
include the IMF and Algeria’s National Office of Statistics which might publish datasets on GDP,
CPI, etc. (Example API call:) GET /api/economy/gdp?year=2021 – returns GDP by region for 2021
from our database (sourced originally from World Bank and distributed across regions). Dashboard
example: a map of GDP per region and a line chart of national GDP over time.
Energy: Use data from OPEC reports for oil production, and IEA (International Energy Agency) for
energy production mix. Also, the Algerian Ministry of Energy might publish stats on electricity
generation and consumption. For real-time electricity, some countries have open grid data; if not,
approximations or periodic reports from the national utility Sonelgaz can be used. (Example: The
system ingests monthly oil production from OPEC’s database, and daily electricity load from a grid
API if available.) Dashboard: an energy facilities map (oil fields, gas pipelines, power plants) and
charts for production by type.
Infrastructure: Government open data portals may have infrastructure project listings (e.g.,
Ministry of Public Works might list major projects). The World Bank Open Data has some
infrastructure indicators (like % roads paved). OpenStreetMap is a source for existing infrastructure
geometry (road networks, railways, etc.). We used Humdata for health facilities in the prototype ;
similarly, humdata or other UN data might have infrastructure datasets. (Example: The script
downloads a roads shapefile and counts total km per region, storing in DB.) Dashboard: an
interactive map with icons on ongoing projects and perhaps progress bars or cost figures.

Health: WHO and World Bank provide health indicators (e.g. life expectancy, mortality rates). The
Ministry of Health or public health institute of Algeria might have data on hospital capacities,
doctor distribution, or disease outbreaks. Humanitarian Data Exchange (humdata) had a dataset
of health facilities with location which we used to demo projects. Example query: “Number of
hospital beds per 1000 people in 2020” – which could be answered via WHO data integrated into the
system. Dashboard: map of hospitals and a sidebar statistic of doctor-per-population by region, etc.
Education: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) has detailed education data (literacy rates,
enrollment, etc.) for countries. National education ministry data on number of schools, students,
teachers by region would be ideal if available publicly. Dashboard: chart literacy rate trend, map
highlighting regions by school density, list of universities locations.
Agriculture: FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) offers data on crop production, land use, etc.,
often via their FAOSTAT database. Also, the Algerian Ministry of Agriculture might publish annual
reports on cereal production, etc. Satellite data (like from MODIS) could be used for vegetation index
if environment aspects overlap. Example: ingest annual wheat production by province from a FAO
dataset. Dashboard: map of agricultural output per region, and line chart of production over years,
possibly segmented by crop.
Environment: Multiple sources: NASA or NOAA for climate data (temperature, precipitation trends),
Climate Watch for emissions data, Yale EPI for environmental performance indices. Air quality data
might come from OpenAQ if there are monitoring stations. Also, global datasets for things like
deforestation (e.g., Global Forest Watch) could be used. Example: subscribe to NASA’s GIBS for
monthly temperature anomaly maps or use OpenWeatherMap API for real-time air quality in major
cities. Dashboard: if real-time, show current air quality in cities; if historical, show CO2 emissions
trend, etc.
Technology: ITU (International Telecommunication Union) provides ICT indicators (internet
penetration, mobile subscriptions). World Bank also has some technology adoption stats (like %
internet users). Additionally, any local data on number of tech startups, R&D spending from UNESCO
could be included. Dashboard: a chart of internet usage over time and perhaps a map with mobile
coverage (if data exists).
Internal Affairs (Governance/Population): National statistical office data on population (by
region, by year) is fundamental. Also data on internal security (crime rates via perhaps UNODC or
local police stats) if available. UN Population Division provides overall population trends. Example
API: GET /api/internal/population?year=2020 returns population of each region (which
could be used to normalize other indicators). Dashboard: map shaded by population density, and a
demographic pyramid chart if age distribution data is present.
Transportation: Ministry of Transport might have data on traffic counts, or TomTom Traffic Index
provides congestion levels for cities. OpenFlight data for airports, UNCTAD for port shipping data,
etc. We could integrate open transit feeds if any exist (GTFS data for public transport in big cities).
Dashboard: map with major transport routes; maybe real-time location of trains or buses (if
available); or a chart of traffic index by time of day.

(The system would ideally have a detailed data catalog listing each dataset, source URL, update frequency, and
license.)
B. Example Queries & Dashboard Snapshots:
Example User Query (Internal): Q: "Show me the economic and health overview of Algiers province in
2022." A: The console zooms to Algiers on the map, highlights it, and displays a panel: “Algiers - 2022:
Population 3.4M; GDP \$35 billion (5% of national, +2% vs 2021); Unemployment 9%; Hospitals: 12 (3000
beds); COVID-19 cases: 5,000 in 2022.” plus small charts showing GDP and population trends for
Algiers over the past decade. (Data is fictional for illustration).
Example API Usage: A developer or power user could query the REST API directly. E.g., GET /api/
environment/airquality?region=Oran might return { "region": "Oran", "aqi": 120,
"level": "Unhealthy", "timestamp": "2025-07-27T10:00:00Z" } . This indicates the
current air quality index in Oran. Another: GET /api/transportation/traffic?city=Algiers
returns a JSON of traffic congestion % for key roads or an average.
Dashboard Screenshot Description: The main dashboard might look like: On the left, tabs for each
domain (with icons next to names for quick ID). Suppose Economy is selected – the map on right is
colored by GDP per capita, the sidebar below the tabs shows a year slider set to latest year, and
below that perhaps two key figures: "National GDP: \$160 B" and "GDP Growth: 3.1%". At bottom of
sidebar, a theme toggle and an AI assistant chat icon. On the map, regions are labeled or tooltipped
with their name and value. The user clicks on one region; a pop-up or side panel shows “Region: Oran
– GDP \$X, Population Y, Unemployment Z,” and maybe a small bar chart comparing Oran's GDP to
other regions.
If the user switches to Infrastructure, the map changes to show points (with a legend by type: roads, ports,
etc.). The sidebar might now list filters (e.g. a dropdown to filter projects by type, and a toggle to show only
active projects). A list of projects in view could appear in a scrollable panel.
Each domain’s dashboard is tailored but maintains a consistent overall layout for familiarity. Colors and
icons differ per domain (for example, green for environment, blue for health, etc., consistently used in
charts and map legends).
AI Assistant Conversation: (Later phase) The user opens the chatbot and asks in French: “Quels sont les
trois wilayas les plus peuplées ?” (Which are the three most populated provinces?). The assistant,
understanding French, replies: “Les wilayas les plus peuplées sont Alger (3.5 millions), Oran (1.5 million)
et Blida (1.2 million) d’après les données de 2023 .” (Citing the data source in the internal logs or
just stating "according to 2023 stats"). It might also highlight those on the map with a numbered
marker.
(Note: Citations like in the assistant’s answer are for this document’s traceability, but in-app the assistant
would reference the National Statistics source.)
This concludes the technical blueprint. By following this phased plan and architecture, developers can
implement a scalable, secure, and feature-rich Strategic Command Console that provides Algeria’s
leadership and citizens with unprecedented insight into the nation’s vital statistics and operations across all

domains. The use of open-source technology and open data ensures transparency and sustainability, while
the modular design allows the system to evolve (such as integrating AI and new data streams) and remain a
strategic asset for years to come.
